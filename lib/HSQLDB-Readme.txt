This is HSQLDB 1.8.1.3. Newer (2.x) versions are available but due to behavioural
changes, are NOT recommended.

Database support is disabled by default in iteration 1, but sample code (for
exploration purposes) can be found in DataAccessObject.java. 

To build under Eclipse, make sure that the jar file is added under the project
properties/Build Path/Libraries (click on Add JARs...).
